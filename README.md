# Adaptive Traffic System Simulation

This project is a 2D simulation of an adaptive traffic system using the Bevy game engine in Rust. It models a city grid with roads, intersections, vehicles, and traffic lights, demonstrating basic traffic flow and management.

## Features

- City grid generation with roads and intersections
- Vehicle spawning and movement along roads
- Traffic light system at major intersections
- Basic collision avoidance and traffic rule adherence

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/qosz/adaptive_traffic_system.git
   cd adaptive_traffic_system

2. Build the project:
   cargo build

3. Run the simulation:
    cargo run
